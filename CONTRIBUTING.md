# How to contribute

## Contributor license agreement

Before we can accept your contribution, we require that you sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA). The process is automated via our pull request flow. Upon submitting your PR, our GitHub bot will determine whether or not you've previously signed our CLA. If you have not, it will provide a link for you to review. Once you have, you have two choices: 

1. Accept the agreement by directing a comment to our bot - `@progressive-open-source I accept`. Your answer will be recorded and your PR can move forward. You won't have to repeat the process for future submissions unless the agreement has been updated.
1. Reject the agreement by directing a comment to our bot - `@progressive-open-source I reject`. Your answer will be recorded and your PR will be blocked from moving forward. You can always accept the agreement later if you change your mind.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including those provided by maintainers, require a code review. We use GitHub pull requests process for this process. Please see [GitHub's documenation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for more information on how to do a pull request.
